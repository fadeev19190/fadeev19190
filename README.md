## About Me

I am a Biotechnology graduate from MIREA - Russian Technological University with a strong analytical mindset and a passion for data science and bioinformatics. My career began with five years of experience as a Chemistry Tutor, where I developed the ability to break down complex concepts into clear explanations. I then transitioned into industry, working as an Analytical Chemist in a Czech company, gaining hands-on experience in applying scientific knowledge to real-world problems.

Currently, I am a bioinformatics student at UCT Prague and an intern in the SAP data preprocessing team, where I work with large-scale data and automation. Over time, I have developed strong programming and data analytics skills, working with Python, SQL, and frameworks such as pandas, PySpark, numpy, and matplotlib. My interests lie at the intersection of data science, bioinformatics, and algorithm development, and I am eager to take on new challenges in these fields.
