## About Me

I am a Biotechnology graduate from MIREA - Russian Technological University with a passion for data science. I have experience working as a Chemistry Tutor for 5 years, where I have honed my skills in explaining complex concepts in a clear and concise manner. Currently, I am employed as an Analytical Chemist at a Czech company, where I have gained valuable experience in applying my scientific knowledge in a practical setting.

Recently, I have started to learn technical skills, such as Python, frameworks, and libraries such as pandas, PySpark, numpy, matplotlib, and SQL. I have a strong foundation in scientific principles and analytical thinking, and I am dedicated and passionate about learning new skills and taking on new challenges.
