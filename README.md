## About Me

I’m a data scientist with a background in bioinformatics and chemistry, based in Prague. I hold a BSc in Biotechnology from MIREA — Russian Technological University (2017–2021), and I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague (2023–present).

Professionally, I’ve worked across analytics and scientific domains: I was an Analytical Chemist (HPLC peptide purity analysis and reporting), then a Data Analyst focused on pricing and market analysis and building internal dashboards, and I’m currently a Data Enablement Intern at SAP, supporting large-scale data preprocessing and extraction workflows with Python and SQL.

My interests sit at the intersection of data science, bioinformatics, and algorithm development—especially NLP, predictive modeling, and building reliable data pipelines from messy real-world sources.
